# ✅ File Organization Complete

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

Successfully organized the Moodle AI Processor project files into a clean, logical structure as requested.

## 📁 Key Changes Made

### 1. **FEEDBACK_DELIVERY_OPTIONS.md → stage1_manual/docs/**
- ✅ Moved to `stage1_manual/docs/FEEDBACK_DELIVERY_OPTIONS.md`
- Now properly located with Stage 1 documentation
- Co-located with relevant manual processing code

### 2. **Separated Documentation by Stage**
- ✅ `STAGE1_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` → `stage1_manual/docs/`
- ✅ `STAGE2_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` → `stage2_automated/docs/`
- ✅ `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` → `docs/` (general project overview)

### 3. **Created Organized Directory Structure**
```
📁 docs/                          # General project documentation
   ├── DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md         # Main development log
   ├── USAGE.md                   # Usage instructions
   └── PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md    # This organization guide

📁 stage1_manual/docs/            # Stage 1 specific documentation
   ├── STAGE1_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md  # Stage 1 development history
   └── FEEDBACK_DELIVERY_OPTIONS.md # Feedback delivery solutions

📁 stage2_automated/docs/         # Stage 2 specific documentation
   └── STAGE2_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md  # Stage 2 development history

📁 scripts/                       # Utility scripts (cleaned from root)
   ├── setup.py
   └── example.py
```

### 4. **Cleaned Root Directory**
- ✅ Removed duplicate `main_new.py`
- ✅ Moved utility scripts to `scripts/`
- ✅ Organized documentation into appropriate folders
- ✅ Kept only essential files at root level

## 🎯 Current Root Directory (Clean & Organized)
```
moodle-ai-processor/
├── main.py              # Main CLI entry point
├── README.md            # Project overview
├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
├── .gitignore          # Git ignore rules
├── config/             # Configuration files
├── src/                # Core shared modules
├── stage1_manual/      # Stage 1 + its documentation
├── stage2_automated/   # Stage 2 + its documentation  
├── docs/               # General project docs
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts
└── tests/              # Test files
```
