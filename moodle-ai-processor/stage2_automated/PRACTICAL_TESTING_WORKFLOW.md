# This should work - verify API can see GUI-created content
python sandbox_explorer.py
```

#### **5B: Create Evidence Package**
```

3. Error messages when trying forum/quiz functions
4. Specific function names that need permissions
```

## üìã TESTING CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ **What We CAN Test Today**:
- [x] GUI content creation (sections, pages, forums, quizzes)
- [x] API reading of GUI-created content structure
- [x] User enrollment verification
- [x] Course metadata access

### ‚ùå **What We CANNOT Test (Need ITO Permissions)**:
- [ ] Reading forum discussions/posts via API
- [ ] Adding forum replies via API
- [ ] Reading quiz attempts/answers via API
- [ ] Automated grading via API
- [ ] Creating content via API

---

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### **Immediate Results** (Today):
1. ‚úÖ Confirm API can read GUI-created content structure
2. ‚úÖ Document exact forum/quiz IDs for future API testing
3. ‚úÖ Create realistic test content for permission testing
4. ‚ùå Confirm forum/quiz APIs are blocked (expected)

### **After ITO Permission Grant**:
1. üîÑ Forum reading: `mod_forum_get_forum_discussions`
2. üîÑ Forum writing: `mod_forum_add_discussion_post`
3. üîÑ Quiz reading: `mod_quiz_get_quiz_attempts`
4. üîÑ Quiz grading: `mod_quiz_save_attempt`

## üìß EVIDENCE FOR ITO COLLEAGUES

### **Proof of Concept**:
- Screenshots showing GUI content creation working
- API responses showing content structure is readable
- Error logs showing exactly which permissions are needed

### **Clear Request**:
```
Dear ITO Colleagues,

We have successfully tested the sandbox and can confirm:

‚úÖ WORKING: Content reading, course structure, user enrollment
‚ùå NEED PERMISSIONS: Forum functions, Quiz functions, Content creation

Specific functions we need enabled:
‚Ä¢ mod_forum_get_forum_discussions
‚Ä¢ mod_forum_add_discussion_post  
‚Ä¢ mod_quiz_get_quizzes_by_courses
‚Ä¢ mod_quiz_get_quiz_attempts

We have created test content in Course 99 ready for API testing once permissions are granted.
```

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Complete this workflow** (estimated 45 minutes)
2. **Document results** with screenshots and API responses
3. **Send evidence package** to ITO colleagues
4. **Request specific API permissions** listed above
5. **Resume testing** once permissions are granted

---

**Start with Step 1 and work through systematically. This will give us concrete evidence of what works and what needs permissions from ITO!** üéØ
