Let's review the python codes we've got for stage 1
We need to process some json file downloaded from HKBU moodle forum and send system prompts to LLM via API 

/workspaces/HKBUmoodle/moodle-ai-processor/stage1_manual/uploads/discussion-week1-section38.json 
we need to take each student's outline and send to LLM via API and seek feedback against the sample outline here /workspaces/HKBUmoodle/moodle-ai-processor/stage1_manual/uploads/sampleOutline.html we'll have an aggregate feedback to identify issues among students' outline making reference to their work 

our analysis was not completed 
let's generate a feedback report to each outline and indicate the name with some comments on how to improve - let's create an html file that can posted to Moodle
