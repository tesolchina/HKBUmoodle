# Student Outline Feedback System - Stage 1 Manual

This system processes student discussion forum posts from Moodle and generates AI-powered feedback on their essay outlines.

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate HTML Feedback Reports

```bash
cd /workspaces/HKBUmoodle/moodle-ai-processor/stage1_manual
python quick_report.py
```

This will automatically:
- Find the latest analysis file
- Generate a comprehensive HTML report (`moodle_feedback_report.html`)
- Create individual student reports in `individual_reports/` folder

### 2. Post to Moodle

#### Main Report
- Open `moodle_feedback_report.html` in your browser
- Copy the content and paste into a Moodle forum post
- This gives students an overview of class performance and individual feedback

#### Individual Reports  
- Each student gets a personalized HTML report
- Can be sent via Moodle messages or email
- Located in `individual_reports/[Student_Name]_feedback.html`

## Files Generated

### Main Report (`moodle_feedback_report.html`)
- Class overview and aggregate analysis
- Individual feedback for all students
- Teaching priorities and next steps
- Ready to post directly to Moodle forum

## Tips for Moodle Posting

1. **Preview First**: Open HTML files in browser to check formatting
2. **Copy Content**: Copy the inner content (not the full HTML with head/body tags)
3. **Moodle Formatting**: Moodle will preserve most CSS styling
4. **Individual Delivery**: Send individual reports via Moodle messages for privacy

## Regenerating Reports

If you need to regenerate reports with different formatting:

```bash
# Using specific analysis file
python html_report_generator.py processed/outline_feedback_analysis_20250910_072551.json --output new_report.html --individual

# Quick regeneration with latest analysis
python quick_report.py
```

## Customization

The HTML templates in `html_report_generator.py` can be modified to:
- Change color schemes
- Add institution branding
- Modify feedback section layout
- Adjust responsive design for mobile

## Next Steps

After posting feedback:
1. Students review their individual feedback
2. Students revise their outlines based on suggestions
3. Peer review session using improved outlines
4. Final outline submission with revisions marked
